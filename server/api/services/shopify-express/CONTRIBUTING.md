# How to contribute
The goal of this project is to provide a few abstractions that make it easy to use the Shopify API in an Express.js app.

We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or just correct a typo, please feel free to do so.

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Testing your changes

We use an example app to demonstrate the functionality of this library. You can use that app as a way to test the changes you are making to this library. NPM allows you to point the package.json to [local paths](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#local-paths)
